        h4 🌌 Be Respectful
        p Treat everyone with kindness and courtesy. Diverse thoughts are welcome, but harassment, hate speech, or offensive behavior are not tolerated.

      .box
        h4 🧠 Ask with Clarity
        p Clearly describe your question or topic with context. This helps others understand your perspective and offer accurate responses.

      .box
        h4 📚 Answer with Intent
        p Provide meaningful, thoughtful, and respectful answers. Avoid sarcasm or vague responses — Qastra is about clarity and helpfulness.

      .box
        h4 🔭 Stay on Topic
        p Keep discussions aligned with the question or category. Off-topic responses make it harder for others to find value in the thread.

      .box
        h4 🚫 No Spam or Self-Promotion
        p Qastra is a knowledge-sharing space — not a place for marketing, irrelevant links, or repetitive content. Keep the feed clean.

      .box
        h4 🛠️ Constructive Feedback
        p Critique ideas, not people. When giving feedback, focus on helping others improve, not on tearing them down.

      .box
        h4 🛰️ Report When Needed
        p If you see something harmful, spammy, or inappropriate, report it. Moderation helps keep Qastra a safe space for curiosity and learning.

      .box
        h4 🌟 Encourage Curiosity
        p Celebrate curiosity. Whether someone's a beginner or expert, everyone deserves encouragement and space to explore their thoughts.

      .box
        h4 🧭 Respect Privacy
        p Don't share private info (yours or others') on public threads. Qastra is a public community — keep it secure and professional.

      .box
        h4 💡 Inspire, Don’t Intimidate
        p Use your knowledge to inspire others, not show off. Help others rise with you — that's the Qastra way.

      .box
        h4 🚀 Keep It Helpful
        p Every interaction should aim to inform, guide, or support. Before posting, ask yourself: “Will this help someone?”
